# List of cameras invloved in calibration
# format: [camera1_name, camera1_dof, camera1_max_delta_angle
#          camera2_name, camera2_dof, camera2_max_delta_angle]
# cameraX_name can be any name to distinguish different cameras inside the interface
# max_delta_angle is a security measure to avoid movement when target angles and current angles of a camera are not too far away from one another.
# This can lead to collision issues for some cameras (e.g. when attached to an arm). Setting it to 0 turns it off (only recommended for pan/tilt cameras)

# collection of uncertainties. each uncertainty consists of 5 parameters:
# [parent frame, child frame, last parent-branch frame (directly connected to parent marker), last child-branch frame (directly connected to child marker), parent marker, child marker]
# the uncertainties will be calibrated in the same order they appear in the uncertainties_list
# last parent-branch frame and last child-branch frame have to be available from TF from the very beginning, so that the routine can build the kinematic chains
# only transforms prior to last parent-branch frame and last child-branch frame can be used as uncertainties
