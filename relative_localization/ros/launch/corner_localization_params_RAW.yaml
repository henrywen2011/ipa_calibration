# frame which is used to build the whole detection (polygons, etc..) upon, it can be assigned with an existing frame or a yet unknown frame
# existing frame: All the detection will be built upon the assigned frame (e.g. robot's base frame)
# unknown frame: A new frame will be created relative to odom_combined_frame_ and the start position (base_frame) of the robot (facing the front wall).
# the frame will be set up once at startup and prevents that robot rotations mess up the reference frame detection.
